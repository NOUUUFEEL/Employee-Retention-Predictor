Project Overview
The project uses employee data from various sources, including survey results, general data, and performance reviews, to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of employee attrition. The process involves the following key steps:

Dataset Loading and Initial Analysis: Importing and summarizing each dataset to understand the structure and potential issues.
Data Merging and Comprehensive Analysis: Combining multiple datasets based on employee identifiers and performing a deeper analysis to understand relationships.
Data Imputation: Handling missing data with KNN for numeric columns and Random Forest for categorical columns to ensure a complete dataset.
Data Encoding: Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding to prepare the data for ML models.
Feature Scaling: Applying RobustScaler to scale features, mitigating the impact of outliers, especially in salary and performance-related metrics.
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
Model Evaluation and Selection: Testing multiple classification models to predict employee attrition, evaluating them based on various performance metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the models to optimize their performance.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the final model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-Validation: Implementing cross-validation to ensure the model’s generalizability.
Performance Analysis: Comparing the results of different models to select the best one.
Interpretation of Results: Understanding the final model’s predictions and providing actionable insights for the company.
